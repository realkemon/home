<!-- STORY -->
**Campaign: 'Rocket Base' (2/3)**
 <br>
After slowing down the Allied attack at the coastal fortress, the Axis set up position in a fortified storage facility. Having narrowly lost the confidential documents in Ice, the Allies have to launch a direct attack on this storage facility, as it is the only way to gain intel on the exact whereabouts of the secret rocket base reported in this area. Hence, the Allies attempt to infiltrate the facility, steal those documents and radio them to OSA headquarters for decyphering.

## Specs and Credits

### Options
 
ET maps are played in different gamemodes and configurations, occasionally calling for different settings. To avoid maintaining separate variations of the same map, optional features have been added, which can be toggled in the map script `pk3/maps/<mapname>.script`. Toggle the optional features by (un-)commenting the respective line. Upload the changed mapscript to your server's mapscript directory *(path depends on mod)*. The following optional features are included:</div>

* [x] setstate TJ_clip invisible				        // clip preventing TJ over storage wall (default disabled)
* [x] trigger radio_ladder_original remove	 // make outer radio bunker ladder retractable with a lever up top (default static ladder)
* [x] setstate allied_hut_doors invisible  	// widen the Allied spawn hut exits by opening up the other door half (default open)
* [x] trigger gramophone_hint remove		      // disable the gramophone entirely (default enabled)
* [x] trigger axis_barracks_door open_door	 // open a connection doorway from Axis upper barracks spawn to garage spawn (default closed)
* [x] setstate guidance_system invisible	   // hide the wire-based guidance system connecting documents and transmitter (default enabled)
* [x] globalaccum 2 bitset 1				            // disable map explanation routine during warm-up (non-functional in v18. Can be disregarded.)

### Source
Since we are talking about an open-source game, in my opinion as much as possible should be available to the public. In that spirit, the map source, along with sources of my other maps, can be found in this repo. It is kept up-to-date with all latest changes, which means the map source does not necessarily reflect the status of the last release.

### Credits
This is not my own map. It is a faithful overhaul of an existing map created by **Moonkey**.
<br>
They still hold all the rights to the map design and original idea and I do not claim ownership of it.
